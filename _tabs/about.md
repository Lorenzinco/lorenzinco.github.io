I'm a currently active member of the Roman CTF team [TheRomanXploit](https://theromanxpl0.it).

As for now I'm studying at the master in computer science course at Sapienza university of Rome, as well as tutoring binary exploitation for the [CyberChallenge.it](https://cyberchallenge.it) n00b5.

My main intrests are binary exploitation and SAT solving, i plan on posting intresting writeups on this blog as soon as i put the effort to actually make some.
