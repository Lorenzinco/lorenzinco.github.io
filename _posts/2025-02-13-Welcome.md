Welcome to my blog!

This is the first post ever being made. I still don't know what i should be writing on those but whatever, creativity will come up while i'm typing.

# My CTF journey

I plan on making this blog the primary journal of my CTF journey, even though I'm starting a little bit late (I've started playing CTF's in 2023) I've gotten to the point where I'm not so much of a noob anymore (even though I'm kind of a rookie still).

I will focus primarely on the challenges that i found the most intresting as well as those that introduced a new concept to me that I didn't really know much about.

# SAT solving

My love is and will always lie in boolean satisfiability. Even though i perfectly know that this goes on a completely different direction from what a technical nerdy blog about CTF's should be, I love the subject and i still want to find out about my findings on this regard.

That's it for the first post, in the end I've written way more than i would've hoped from the incipit, I really hope that somebody will find my posts usefull!
